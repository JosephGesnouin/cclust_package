Welcome to Coclust's documentation!
==========================================

Coclust provides both a Python package, and a ready to use script to perform co-clustering.

The script enables the user to process a dataset with co-clustering algorithms without writing Python code.

The Python package provides an API for Python programmers.  This API allows to use the algorithms in a pipeline with Scikit-learn library for example.


**Coclust** includes implementations of the algorithms described in the following papers: 

* `Melissa Ailem, Francois Role, and Mohamed Nadif. 2015. Co-clustering Document-term Matrices by Direct Maximization of Graph Modularity. In Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM '15). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 1807-1810. <http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2806639&CFID=566459486&CFTOKEN=63982807>`_
* L. Labiod and M. Nadif. Co-clustering for Binary Data with Maximum Modularity. ICONIP (2), 700-708, 2011.
