Welcome to Coclust's documentation!
==========================================

Coclust is both a Python package, and a ready to use script to do co-clustering.

The script provides the user a way to process a dataset with co-clustering algorithms without the need to know Python.

The Python package provides an API to do it with Python and to use the algorithms in a pipeline with Scikit-learn library for example.
